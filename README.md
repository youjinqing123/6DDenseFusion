Over the next few years, autonomous robots and
functionalities are expected to gain increased importance for the
shop floor. Perception and the derivation of autonomous behavior
is of crucial importance in this context. We present a combined
object recognition and pose estimation pipeline to generate pose
estimates with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) for bin picking,
specifically targeting the suitability for challenging scenarios
with texture-less, metallic parts in industrial environments. The
pipeline is based on open source algorithms, combining Convo-
lutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and feature-matching methods
to create an effective 6DoF pose estimate. We evaluate our
approach on several industrial components using a articulated
arm robot to guarantee a high level of comparability during
the different measurement runs. We further quantify the results
using known error metrics for pose estimation, compare the
results to established approaches and provide statistical insight
into the achieved outcomes to assess the robustness and reliability.
